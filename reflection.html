  <h2> Group Reflection:</h2>
  <h3>The Good: </h3>
  <p>Being the freshman at RMIT university, there have been some hardships during the journey of implementing our first project but that won’t back us down. The team’s bond grew stronger over time, and we manage to cooperate more effectively despite the differences in our personalities and schedules. With the unique personality trait of each member, it becomes an advantage in providing the group with new concepts and useful data which would become handy in the progress of making this project.  While working, our team displayed many factors that contributed to building a sustainable team workflow and helps the team work more effectively.
    <li>Organizing: Our team have succeeded in maintaining a smooth work flow, due to our regular meeting, regular work check,and we always finish our role before the deadlines which don’t resulted in any slow down while carrying out our project. We also make some progress in planning ahead every single tasks in details to prevent unwanted halts in the timeline and make the most out of the given time.</li>
    <li>Commitment: Every members are all enthusiastic in the progress of making this project. They are usually on time on every meeting and also interactive in giving out new idea, opinion. Their hardworking also displayed throughout their the progress of implementing on each individual tasks.</li>
    <li>Frequent communication: Whenever there’s an obstacle appear and that one team member don’t know how to solve it on their own, they would ask for via messenger or team, the other team member would provide support in completing the task. The bonding between our team also grow stronger by time.</li>
    </p>
    <h3>The Bad:</h3>
    <p>Beside those aforementioned strengths, there are still several issues that need to be settled. The first thing is about the close-by progress checking. Instead of checking at the scheduled date, we should update our progress more frequently and more communicatively. To achieve this, we can be more engaging with other teammates, for example by being proactive in seeking help or having more interactive conversations. From there, The groups' communicating and cooperating skills could be boosted drastically. The mentioned characteristics can also be improved if we had more offline meetings, since it can provide members with more opportunity to strengthen the team's association and understanding.</p>
    <h3>The Surpising:</h3>
    <p>With a project that spans over three months, there is bound to be factors that gave us a hard time. However, what really surprised us during our time with the project were one of the project requirements and the workload in the final weeks of the semester. First, when we were making the timeline of the project for our proposal, we intended to make the timeline when we actually had gone through with the project and made a prototype by the end of the semester. However, after receiving the early feedback for our proposal, we had to completely change our approach to the timeline and make it more realistic. We spent a week redesigning the timeline to focus more on the project report rather than building a product from scratch. Secondly, when the final weeks of the semester came, we were shocked by the amount of work from all subjects since this was our first semester in RMIT. The way we overcame this for the project was to identify parts that needed to be finished first and put more effort into those parts rather than distributing our effort across the work. This will result in some parts being rushed in the project but that is still better than us not being able to do all of our tasks. Surprises are bound to appear in a project and I think we handled them well enough for it to not affect us too much.</p>
    <h3>The Experience: </h3>
    <p>Being inexperienced and new to the field of IT, this project is the very first opportunity for us to approach the concept of building an IT system. Hence, the experience we gain throughout the course is valuable and fundamental for our future:</p>
    <h4>1. Teamwork skill:</h4>
    <p>Through collaborating with members with different backgrounds and preferences, this project has taught us how to work in a team. The first thing to do is to overcome the oddness of new peers and publish a communication method that is compatible with everyone. Then, it is necessary to organize a work structure where team members will be involved with decision making and task division. This will then be followed by the regular meetings and milestones to check the progress and evaluate the final result. Having these knowledge in mind, our group will be able to perform even better in the next projects.</p>
    <h4>2. How to build a project: </h4>
    <p>This project brought us a closer view of how a project is constructed from scratch. We were able to be involved in the most fundamental steps such as brainstorming and topic choosing to the more detailed tasks like planning out scope and limits. Although there might be struggles and challenges in the beginning, we were still eventually able to create a project proposal and a final report. These results might be inconsiderable but the growth our team experienced is significant and those knowledge will become great assets in our future career.</p>
    <h4>3. How to build a website: </h4>
    <p>This course presented us the chance of building our first website which is a fundamental knowledge for every IT member. Moreover, it was also our first attempt in collaborating through GitHub. Even though the construction of the website is complex enough, the most challenging aspect for us is the task division for members since everyone has their own share of knowledge assets and standards.  By overcoming all of those difficulties, we have obtained a solid foundation for working in the IT field in the future.

    <h2>Individual Reflection:</h2>
    <h3>Hoang Nguyen Nhat Minh:</h3>
    <p>Being the first project upon coming to the university, there were many hardships and challenges that we went through; nevertheless, the project is still a success in its own way. Fundamentally, we collaborated and supported each other to produce results despite the oddness and unfamiliarity of being first-year students. The members were punctual in completing tasks, and their commitment always encouraged me to perform better. On the other hand, there were some improvements that could enhance teamwork. Even though the regular meeting is informative and resourceful, the other communication seems lacking as the members only report the difficulties they faced when it is time for another discussion. This led to the postponement of some tasks or even a change of plan. The one thing that surprised me during the project was the density of deadlines in the last few weeks. Even with previous planning, our team still finds it rushed to complete our tasks accordingly. In conclusion, our team has collaborated productively; though there are still some mistakes that need improvements, this experience will be valuable for any projects in the future.

    <h3>Nguyen Duc Trong:</h3>
    <p>Since this is the first time I am working in university’s environment, there are many unfamiliar things that I have to get used to. Fortunately, that journey has gone along with this IoT project as an improvement pill for university life. It helps me acquire a knowledge of team working and time management. Despite several stoppages and the complexity of the project, our team still managed to get work exceptionally done, come rain or shine. It is fortunate to work with many inspired teammates who are always encouraging each other to be better. We always stay connected through social media and usual meetings to check our performance and update our work. It was pretty beneficial since we can early identify the setback from the project and then collaborate through scheduled meetings to solve it. As I can say, all members were happy to put lots of effort into their given tasks and I was motivated to see it. After the project, I realized that to be successful in IoT, it not only takes high technical skill but also effective teamwork with the organization, business and other developers. And for me, there are still a lot of stuff for me to seek and experience in the road becoming front-end developers and also full-stack developers

    <h3>Nguyen Ha Minh Chau:</h3>
    <p>Over the time working on this project as a team, there have been many challenges and difficulties throughout our journey, but we have proceeded to overcome those hardships and reach our goal. Our workflow was pretty smooth, assigned tasks is usually submitted on time and we succeeded in collaborating and working together as a team despite being first-year students, who haven't know much about one another. Every member is reliable and punctual when it comes to operating their task, they put much effort into completing it. These are all expressed clearly through the work progress. Though, there are some improvements that could be made to enhance the team's performance. The first thing is that our team is lack of communication. Each member should be more proactive in talking with each other, like notifying the team when there's an issue comes up before each meeting, for better support from other team members and be more open about contributing their opinion on each discussion. One thing that surprised me is how hard it is to host the meeting due to the differences in schedule and the loads of work, and assignments we are undergoing in the last few weeks. One thing I have learned when working as a group is that communication and clear delivery is the key for all member to cooperate and work more efficiently</p>
    <h3>Nguyen Hoang Minh:</h3>
    <p>After three months of working with the team, I felt our group had gone through many ups and downs, but overall we overcame them and produced an efficient workflow for the project. First, I think the members worked with each other well without too many obstructions and it shows in the progress our team made after each week. Every time a task is delegated, it is almost always completed before the deadline so the next meeting can be about planning the next actions to take rather than focusing on the work that needs to be done. Secondly, I feel the team could be more informative and communicative when doing tasks or in a meeting. In our group, there is a lot of individual work and we don’t feel the need to update other members on the progress of our task and only ever talk about it when the task is done. This resulted in a few times when we had to move on with the meeting despite missing materials for that meeting. Thirdly, something that really surprised me was how hard it was to plan ahead meetings because of everyone’s differing schedules and locations. Sometimes the meeting could be held in a place suitable for the contents of the meeting but we could only pick the times when everyone were on campus to hold the meeting. Finally, through this group project, I learnt that good leadership is key for any project. The leader is the person who sets the pace for everything the group does and delegates the tasks efficiently for the sake of the group and the project.
