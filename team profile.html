            <p>I have always known about myself being an introvert, but this test brought me a chance to have an even closer look. INFJ people are often described as idealistic, principled, but also carry a deep sympathy for people to which I regarded as great advantages for working in teams. There is also a characteristic that I found true to myself that is being obsessed with regret about past mistakes. Although that may prove to be a fatal flaw, it can also be a beneficial trait which improves my consciousness while carrying out tasks and learning from past mistakes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="strength">
            <p><strong>Strength:</strong></p>
            <p>The first iconic trait that people think about INFJ which I also regard myself as is being insightful. Although appearances can be the most appealing criteria to judge on something, it is always better to seek for deeper truths in everything, whether it is human, objects or occurrences. Also, INFJ people are famous for being passionate and principled. They follow the core values in their life and always crave and pursue their ideals. These two criteria will make INFJ shine when they find out the dream of their life and strive for it wholeheartedly.</p>

        <div class="career-path">
            <p><strong>Career Path: </strong></p>
            <p>I have always been captivated by the idea of Artificial Intelligence as that is the foundation of technology in the future in my belief. It is just like the beginning of the Internet or the era of computers, humans have just barely excavated the surface of the mysterious concept that is called Artificial Intelligence and there are still more wonders for us to find out. Throughout this Intro to IT course, I want to further indulge myself with knowledge in the IT departments as well as building the base to learn about AI technology.</p>
            <p>Being an INFJ is never a hindrance to my lifelong passion, truthfully, I think they match with each other perfectly. While being over-cautious and obsessed with past mistakes may be detrimental for many people, however, in the IT industry, those traits can make the best out of a developer since they will be better at debugging and being able to learn more after an error.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
            <p>I am an outgoing person when I can open up to everybody at the first meeting. Since social activities are one of the essential aspects of my life, I can ask for testers and gather feedback if there is a project that needs to be tested. With my passion and caring, I never leave my friend in trouble while willing to assist them even if it is far from easy. That is why I love doing team projects because I feel inspired when everyone is willing to put effort into achieving high marks.</p>

        <div class="strength">
            <p><strong>Strength:</strong></p>
            <p>It is true that ENFJ is a straightforward participant, if there are any issues that occur in the teamwork, I will instantly communicate with the group and ask the team to tackle the problem as soon as possible. I am confident about my ability to motivate and bring people together, and from that, increase productivity and fulfillment during the meeting period. Moreover, the ENFJ also never let the person down when they are being depended on.</p>

            <p><strong>Career Path: </strong></p>
            <p>It does not take you to be a very logical and isolating person to be a programmer. I believe that my social traits can also contribute to my IT career. My empathy allowed me to understand better how customers will come and visit my webpage (User Interface). And since IT is a considerably wide and varying field, it is important to observe new things by discussing about the present and future of IT career.</p>

            <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
            <p>I usually refer to myself as an introvert to normal friends and an extrovert to close friends. Whenever I give advice to my friends, I always try to think outside the box and come up with new solutions, and ideas to help them overcome their problems. I also find myself as the energetic type of person whenever I hang out with people, who I feel comfortable around. I also see myself as a straightforward person, mainly because when I have a problem with someone, I would just give them a piece of my mind.  </p>

        <div class="strength">
            <p><strong>Strength:</strong></p>
            <p>The first and foremost feature of the ENTP is knowledgeable which I find quite true because I’m always excited to try and learn new things whenever I had a chance, mainly due to my high curiosity and daring personality. Whenever I do something, I always do some quick thinking beforehand to determine the risks and outcome to choose the best resort I could come up with.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="career-path">
            <p><strong>Career Path: </strong></p>
            <p>As for the reason why, I chose this path in the first place is because of my high interest in robots. When I first watched Big Hero 6, that’s when my interest in robots grow stronger.  After having some quick research in the mentioned fields, I found out that artificial intelligence is also related to robotic fields, and artificial intelligence is a quite promising career in the future which can open the door to much more advanced technology, change our world for the better, provide human with more support. To pursue that goal. I wanted to provide myself with more knowledge in IT and build a sturdy base knowledge for the AI field to continue my journey of becoming an artificial intelligence developer.</p>

        <div class="personality">
            <p><strong>Personality:</strong></p>
            <p>I think of myself as a person who likes to be in the background of things, supporting people instead of being on the main stage and sending big messages to people. Throughout my life, I am seen as an honest and reliable person who my friends can come to and talk about their troubles. This is mostly because I am a good listener and can logically think about why they are having those problems and provide them with solutions I think are practical. I also prefer stability in a project instead of going with what feels right because I like to have a clear plan moving forward. This also means that any disruptions in my plan make me worry a lot and can affect the quality of the work I provide. However, I counteract with my own backup plans so that if those situations ever happen, I already know what to do. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="strength">
            <p><strong>Strength:</strong></p>
            <p>My strengths are that I am frank and direct with my feelings; if I feel that something is troubling me, I will talk about it with people. I am also very determined and dutiful as when I am presented with a task, I make sure that the task will be completed within the timeframe given. Another strength of mine is that I can stay calm under pressure and think logically, so when a deadline is approaching and progress is late, I can make up a plan that ensures the completion of that task which is also practical. </p>

        <div class="career-path">
            <p><strong>Career Path: </strong></p>
            <p>I want to work in Game Development in the future because I have a lot of fun playing games and want to recreate that feeling with more people even if they are not into video games. Also, because the gaming industry is not as accepted in Vietnam as in other places in the world so I want to show society that video games can be relaxing and therapeutic rather than a drug that we should avoid. If I achieve that dream, I can build a stable career that will fit my personality since I prefer doing things that are structured and long-term rather than being spontaneous and being in different working environments.</p>

    <h2>3. Group process</h2>
    <p>Consider that communication is one of the core elements for the success of almost everything. Because of that, our team has put great effort into scheduling our meetup time, we organize our meeting about one to three meetings per week based on the density of each member's schedule, and if the assigned task is too complicated or hard to handle alone, that’s when our meeting volume will be adjusted to a higher rate. Each meeting will be about 1 and half an hour to 3 hours long. Our meeting will usually be hosted on Microsoft Team, due to its flexibility and convenience. We also communicate via Messenger, SMS message, or even call whenever a team’s individual needs help with the task. After each session, members will be assigned to a role, and we will all settle for a specific deadline. For the assigned tasks, our team always makes sure to finish the work before the deadline and publish their work onto Google Drive, where all our members can see and make any adjustments if needed. When a member couldn’t finish their work before the deadlines. If it’s their first time, then we will remind them, but if that ever occurs again, they will have to treat each team member with a drink of their choice.</p>
