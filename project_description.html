  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <h2 id="Overview">1. Overview</h2>
  <h3>Topic:</h3>
  <p>
    Acknowledging the rising demand for education and the flaws in our education system nowadays with the need
    for further improvement in the school management system. We, the School Buddy team have decided to produce
    an app/web where our users can have a more personalized learning experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supposing that communication is one of the keys to many great accomplishments. School Buddy put great efforts 
    into building a platform where our users can communicate easily from one to another, for example, teachers to 
    parents and teachers to students. Each student’s strengths and weaknesses will be shown throughout their performance 
    on the tests and quizzes. Based on that, teachers can have different approaches to different students, to help 
    improve their weak points and maintain their strengths. 
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
  <p>
    This project draws our attention, mostly because we were still in our educational phase, and we can easily be 
    in the user’s shoes to know exactly what needs improving. making it easier to point out the flaws and what 
    should be changed from the user's perspective, specifically from the student's perspective. In addition to 
    the IT trends nowadays, everything is becoming more and more digitalized than ever. Because of this, we are 
    inspired to work on a web, assisting students to perform at their best without being too stressed out 
    (by focusing only on improving their weaknesses), teachers can teach more effectively, and parents can always 
    see how their child did at school. This project would show future employers that they are investing in making 
    education easier and boosting performance, hence the phrase “Work Smarter Not Harder”.

<h3>Aims:</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this project is to create a mainstream student learning and managing system which is as 
    popular as canvas and blackboard. With a friendly interface, this application is suitable for all users, 
    including parents, teachers, and students. For teachers and parents, our duty is to ensure they can receive 
    the latest and most accurate status occurring in the educational courses. This application not only helps 
    teachers, but also parents to access the timetable and course information of their students. Extra information 
    such as tuition fee reminders and academic status will be sent to parents through the inbox section. Besides, 
    Teachers will be helped by lots of features such as obtaining details of courses, which include in their charges 
    through the course section. Additionally, there are categorized cloud storage that carries the essential document 
    like unmarked test files or teaching resources that are easily navigable when it is needed. Finally, yet importantly, 
    the students are expected to derive great benefits from the application. Such as performance checking and goal 
    setting which will illustrate subjects that learners achieved good marks or need to improve. They are also able 
    to access group-finding features to connect with persons who share the same goals.  Students can create a profile 
    to show their aim, major, or even personality which will be also categorized in the teacher and school database if 
    they set it publicly. This will help schools and teachers to utilize and develop every learner's strength and weak 
    points. To sum up, the main objective of our project is to create a school system that can stand out and compete in 
    the industry field. 
</p>
<p>
    To achieve our aim, there are specific goals that we must strive for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Providing user with a complete product and friendly interface. Firstly, the application must be able to perform 
        all the functions we desired (delegating, performance checking, etc.). Secondly, the structure of the website must 
        be intuitive. Also, the graphic, layout, colors that make the interface interactive and attractive. Finally, the 
        product must work well on all platform and devices.
    </li>
    <li>
        Possessing exceptional and convenient features. Primarily, Performance Checking will provide illustration, 
        comparison, and recommended score that students have to achieve in their next tests (which depend on their goal setting). 
        Furthermore, Group finding is exceptionally handy for first-year students and the one who wishes to find equal-intention 
        partners. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure anything in the infrastructure is stable. For instance, the cloud and storage must be available anytime for the 
        user, the security must be strong so the users’ data would not be lost, making the application dependable and trustworthy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Frequent updates through feedback. In the feedback section, every time there is any error or complaint, the team will have 
        to check if it is rational. If it is a valid error, our team will have to work together until we figure out the way to 
        manage it and enhance the system accordingly.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Plan and Progress:
</h3>
<h4>
    <li>How our project began?</li> 
</h4>
<p>
    In the beginning, our group formed hastily because of our concern for the subject’s teamwork-reliant nature. Initially, we 
    were all strangers except for Nhat Minh and Trong who studied high school in the same class. But after the first tutorial 
    class, we decided to form a group because we share the same goals for this subject which was to achieve a Distinction grade, 
    and because we saw that every one of us had a good work ethic. 
</p>
<p>
    After the team had gotten used to each other through talking to each other in classes, the topic of our project had to be 
    decided. This was a process that is arguably the most important as it depicts what we will spend the rest of the semester 
    working on. We had discussions over a week to decide what the project will be about just because “IT” is such a vast topic 
    to cover. Ultimately, we narrowed the topic down to those that are closest to us students and chose the topic of an improved 
    learning system for students and teachers.
</p>
<p>The topic was chosen because we discovered certain aspects of the current learning systems in our country that could use 
    improvements that benefit students and teachers in their path of education. For example, in most public schools the only 
    form of education management system exists in the form of a database file which is not useful for teachers and students who 
    want to improve their learning. And when they do want to improve their learning, they do not know how and where to improve 
    as it often comes from the teacher’s oral or written advice which can be lost if not kept carefully. So, we decided to make 
    this system exist online and accessible so that students and teachers can easily look for the things they want. We also saw 
    that students who have a hard time socializing or speaking to many people harbor difficulties in finding a group, so we also 
    aim to make that a key feature of the product.
</p>
<h4>
    <li>How has the project progressed</li> 
</h4>
<p>Since the start of the project, Nhat Minh has stepped up to be the leader of our group and brining everyone’s ideas together 
    for us to democratically pick. It has worked in our favor as far as there has been no disputes regarding the direction that 
    the project is taking. We also setup a strict schedule of at least two online meetings per week to discuss what we did since 
    the previous meeting, discussing new tasks to be delegated and delegating those tasks accordingly. Aside from that, a Facebook 
    Messenger group was available as an outlet for questions regarding the tasks and short discussions between members. 
</p>
<p>Shortly after choosing our project topic and idea, we ran into a problem while coming up with the project proposal. The main 
    problem was making the timeline as we were unsure if we could realize the project due to our lacking skills as freshmen in 
    the field of IT. We decided to write the timeline as if we were to build the learning management system, despite realizing 
    the low probability of us being able to make it. However, this problem was resolved after submitting the early draft of our 
    project proposal. Our professor commented that we should only make the timeline this way if we were to make a product. This 
    was the first major change that we made to our project proposal; we changed the timeline so that it was realistic according 
    to our deadlines for the assignments of the course.
</p>
<p>
    We proceed with the actual project proposal by making sure to read the rubric thoroughly before writing the individual parts. 
    Members also frequently cross check each other’s work to make sure that no one was having any problems with parts of the 
    proposal since everyone received the same marks for the project. After everyone was done with their part for the proposal, 
    we had a reviewing and editing session then submitted it for grading. 
</p>
<p>Afterwards, we had a choice between making the presentation and writing the project report. On paper, the project report is 
    worth more and should be put to work immediately but after discussions, we decided to do an early draft of the presentation 
    first because the project report would require a continuous stream of work and making the presentation draft quickly removes 
    some of the workload we would have at the end of the semester when we have other subjects to worry about. Upon making the 
    presentation, we stumbled upon a problem we have, which was the visuals for our product which we didn’t have at the time. 
    This called for a meeting to discuss and create the design of the web-application that we envisioned in our plans. The meeting 
    did not go to plan at first since we argued over which tool to use (Canva or Figma), but after some consideration we used Figma 
    for the design and swiftly came up with an original design while still basing it off the current learning system we use (Canvas).
</p>
<p>Onto the final stretch of our group project, we started planning for the project report and how to best write it. Because it was 
    almost the end of the semester and we had other subjects’ tests coming up as well, we had to manage our time really well in order 
    to do this part effectively. But in the end, we finished the report in time to start working on the website.
</p>
<h4>
    <li>How the project can be improved in the future?</li> 
</h4>
<p>Currently, we have only scratched the surface of our group’s idea and haven’t carried out anything yet. However, with some research 
    into the technologies that are required for the learning management system, we can implement it and that would be the goal for our 
    foreseeable future as well. First, we can create a framework of the website using Python and SQL. And then using HTML, CSS, and 
    JavaScript, we can make the front-end of the web-application.
</p>
<p>Next up, since our Scope is quite big, we aim to find out which features are most important and refine them so that the web-application 
    can be even more user-friendly.  This also helps users not be overwhelmed when using the application and make the product more 
    appealing to users of all ages.
</p>
<p>Another important step to take in the future would be to test our product and have people test it. This will give us insight on how 
    effective the platform is and how it can be improved so that we can compete with the current learning management systems like Canvas 
    or Google Classroom. 
</p>
<p>And finally, since people’s learning information needs to be private and we respect that privacy a lot. What we can do is research 
    on cybersecurity and apply it to our project so that users can rely on the system keeping their information safe. 
</p>
<p>So, with effectiveness, user-friendliness, and information security as our top values for the product, we hope that in the future 
    we can make learning management easier for both students and teachers, which will improve the quality of education.

Specifically, he needs to coordinate with group members to construct the project plan, which includes the milestones for each phase and a working timeline with precise detail. Also, Minh oversees determining the group's pace and adjusting the team result accordingly to match the expectations. Moreover, he is responsible for evaluating the outcome and combining parts of the product.</td>
        <td>My mission in this project is to create a clear, energetic interface which is easy to access all the units. To accomplish this, the developer requires not only skills but also being predictable in designing a website interface. For example, I must predict all the possibilities when a new user visits the page. So that I can perceive where to put the essential functions that are easily navigable. Moreover, since this is an educational application, the font and color must be engaging and go well together to create the best experience for our users. Beside the conveniences, I also have to ensure that the Frontend section can operate effectively with the Backend sections so the website can run effectively. Doing this job exceptionally would require me to have solid experience in CSS, JavaScript with assistance like React and CSS library.</td>
        <td>As the project’s back-end developer, Minh will decide how to best design the web application framework. This includes writing clean code that is readable for other members to be able to read and implement front-end features smoothly and working with SQL and Python to create a system that handles the inputs from users using a database. However, something that Minh can’t ignore is how to make the system as efficient as possible to make the process from request to action seamless.</td>
        <td>More and more information is being exposed on the internet every day due to weak security. Having your information exposed on the internet is no joke, it could result in many serious problems which could lead to money lost, fraud. That’s why cybersecurity plays an important role in almost everything online nowadays. The person working in the cybersecurity field means that they will mainly be responsible for protecting the data, preventing the application from many forms of cyberattacks, and unauthorized access, solve security leaks as soon as one is detected. For this project, the role of cybersecurity will be carried out by Chau, making sure no leakage of data would occur, maintain the security of the application. To do so, she is required to have some knowledge of how a network operates, and how the application communicates, some basic knowledge in C, JavaScript, Python is a must. Her job is to troubleshoot the application, detect malicious code and whenever there’s a problem identified, establish a theory of probable cause, test the theory to determine the cause and lastly implement, come up with solutions.</td>
