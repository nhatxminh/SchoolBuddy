  <h1>Project Description</h1>
  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <h3>Topic:</h3>
  <p>
    Acknowledging the rising demand for education and the flaws in our education system nowadays with the need
    for further improvement in the school management system. We, the School Buddy team have decided to produce
    an app/web where our users can have a more personalized learning experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supposing that communication is one of the keys to many great accomplishments. School Buddy put great efforts 
    into building a platform where our users can communicate easily from one to another, for example, teachers to 
    parents and teachers to students. Each student’s strengths and weaknesses will be shown throughout their performance 
    on the tests and quizzes. Based on that, teachers can have different approaches to different students, to help 
    improve their weak points and maintain their strengths. 
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
  <p>
    This project draws our attention, mostly because we were still in our educational phase, and we can easily be 
    in the user’s shoes to know exactly what needs improving. making it easier to point out the flaws and what 
    should be changed from the user's perspective, specifically from the student's perspective. In addition to 
    the IT trends nowadays, everything is becoming more and more digitalized than ever. Because of this, we are 
    inspired to work on a web, assisting students to perform at their best without being too stressed out 
    (by focusing only on improving their weaknesses), teachers can teach more effectively, and parents can always 
    see how their child did at school. This project would show future employers that they are investing in making 
    education easier and boosting performance, hence the phrase “Work Smarter Not Harder”.
