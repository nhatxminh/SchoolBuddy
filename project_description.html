    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <div>
        <h2 id="Overview">1. Overview</h2>
        <h3>Topic:</h3>
        <p>
            Acknowledging the rising demand for education and the flaws in our education system nowadays with the need
            for further improvement in the school management system. We, the School Buddy team have decided to produce
            an app/web where our users can have a more personalized learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supposing that communication is one of the keys to many great accomplishments. School Buddy put great efforts 
            into building a platform where our users can communicate easily from one to another, for example, teachers to 
            parents and teachers to students. Each student’s strengths and weaknesses will be shown throughout their performance 
            on the tests and quizzes. Based on that, teachers can have different approaches to different students, to help 
            improve their weak points and maintain their strengths. 
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>
        <p>
            This project draws our attention, mostly because we were still in our educational phase, and we can easily be 
            in the user’s shoes to know exactly what needs improving. making it easier to point out the flaws and what 
            should be changed from the user's perspective, specifically from the student's perspective. In addition to 
            the IT trends nowadays, everything is becoming more and more digitalized than ever. Because of this, we are 
            inspired to work on a web, assisting students to perform at their best without being too stressed out 
            (by focusing only on improving their weaknesses), teachers can teach more effectively, and parents can always 
            see how their child did at school. This project would show future employers that they are investing in making 
            education easier and boosting performance, hence the phrase “Work Smarter Not Harder”.

        <h2 id="Detailed_Description">2. Detailed Description</h2>
        <h3>Aims:</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to create a mainstream student learning and managing system which is as 
            popular as canvas and blackboard. With a friendly interface, this application is suitable for all users, 
            including parents, teachers, and students. For teachers and parents, our duty is to ensure they can receive 
            the latest and most accurate status occurring in the educational courses. This application not only helps 
            teachers, but also parents to access the timetable and course information of their students. Extra information 
            such as tuition fee reminders and academic status will be sent to parents through the inbox section. Besides, 
            Teachers will be helped by lots of features such as obtaining details of courses, which include in their charges 
            through the course section. Additionally, there are categorized cloud storage that carries the essential document 
            like unmarked test files or teaching resources that are easily navigable when it is needed. Finally, yet importantly, 
            the students are expected to derive great benefits from the application. Such as performance checking and goal 
            setting which will illustrate subjects that learners achieved good marks or need to improve. They are also able 
            to access group-finding features to connect with persons who share the same goals.  Students can create a profile 
            to show their aim, major, or even personality which will be also categorized in the teacher and school database if 
            they set it publicly. This will help schools and teachers to utilize and develop every learner's strength and weak 
            points. To sum up, the main objective of our project is to create a school system that can stand out and compete in 
            the industry field. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve our aim, there are specific goals that we must strive for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Providing user with a complete product and friendly interface. Firstly, the application must be able to perform 
                all the functions we desired (delegating, performance checking, etc.). Secondly, the structure of the website must 
                be intuitive. Also, the graphic, layout, colors that make the interface interactive and attractive. Finally, the 
                product must work well on all platform and devices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Possessing exceptional and convenient features. Primarily, Performance Checking will provide illustration, 
                comparison, and recommended score that students have to achieve in their next tests (which depend on their goal setting). 
                Furthermore, Group finding is exceptionally handy for first-year students and the one who wishes to find equal-intention 
                partners. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure anything in the infrastructure is stable. For instance, the cloud and storage must be available anytime for the 
                user, the security must be strong so the users’ data would not be lost, making the application dependable and trustworthy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frequent updates through feedback. In the feedback section, every time there is any error or complaint, the team will have 
                to check if it is rational. If it is a valid error, our team will have to work together until we figure out the way to 
                manage it and enhance the system accordingly.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Plan and Progress:
        </h3>
        <h4>
            <li>How our project began?</li> 
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the beginning, our group formed hastily because of our concern for the subject’s teamwork-reliant nature. Initially, we 
            were all strangers except for Nhat Minh and Trong who studied high school in the same class. But after the first tutorial 
            class, we decided to form a group because we share the same goals for this subject which was to achieve a Distinction grade, 
            and because we saw that every one of us had a good work ethic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After the team had gotten used to each other through talking to each other in classes, the topic of our project had to be 
            decided. This was a process that is arguably the most important as it depicts what we will spend the rest of the semester 
            working on. We had discussions over a week to decide what the project will be about just because “IT” is such a vast topic 
            to cover. Ultimately, we narrowed the topic down to those that are closest to us students and chose the topic of an improved 
            learning system for students and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>The topic was chosen because we discovered certain aspects of the current learning systems in our country that could use 
            improvements that benefit students and teachers in their path of education. For example, in most public schools the only 
            form of education management system exists in the form of a database file which is not useful for teachers and students who 
            want to improve their learning. And when they do want to improve their learning, they do not know how and where to improve 
            as it often comes from the teacher’s oral or written advice which can be lost if not kept carefully. So, we decided to make 
            this system exist online and accessible so that students and teachers can easily look for the things they want. We also saw 
            that students who have a hard time socializing or speaking to many people harbor difficulties in finding a group, so we also 
            aim to make that a key feature of the product.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <li>How has the project progressed</li> 
        </h4>
        <p>Since the start of the project, Nhat Minh has stepped up to be the leader of our group and brining everyone’s ideas together 
            for us to democratically pick. It has worked in our favor as far as there has been no disputes regarding the direction that 
            the project is taking. We also setup a strict schedule of at least two online meetings per week to discuss what we did since 
            the previous meeting, discussing new tasks to be delegated and delegating those tasks accordingly. Aside from that, a Facebook 
            Messenger group was available as an outlet for questions regarding the tasks and short discussions between members. 
        </p>
        <p>Shortly after choosing our project topic and idea, we ran into a problem while coming up with the project proposal. The main 
            problem was making the timeline as we were unsure if we could realize the project due to our lacking skills as freshmen in 
            the field of IT. We decided to write the timeline as if we were to build the learning management system, despite realizing 
            the low probability of us being able to make it. However, this problem was resolved after submitting the early draft of our 
            project proposal. Our professor commented that we should only make the timeline this way if we were to make a product. This 
            was the first major change that we made to our project proposal; we changed the timeline so that it was realistic according 
            to our deadlines for the assignments of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            We proceed with the actual project proposal by making sure to read the rubric thoroughly before writing the individual parts. 
            Members also frequently cross check each other’s work to make sure that no one was having any problems with parts of the 
            proposal since everyone received the same marks for the project. After everyone was done with their part for the proposal, 
            we had a reviewing and editing session then submitted it for grading. 
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards, we had a choice between making the presentation and writing the project report. On paper, the project report is 
            worth more and should be put to work immediately but after discussions, we decided to do an early draft of the presentation 
            first because the project report would require a continuous stream of work and making the presentation draft quickly removes 
            some of the workload we would have at the end of the semester when we have other subjects to worry about. Upon making the 
            presentation, we stumbled upon a problem we have, which was the visuals for our product which we didn’t have at the time. 
            This called for a meeting to discuss and create the design of the web-application that we envisioned in our plans. The meeting 
            did not go to plan at first since we argued over which tool to use (Canva or Figma), but after some consideration we used Figma 
            for the design and swiftly came up with an original design while still basing it off the current learning system we use (Canvas).
        </p>
        <p>Onto the final stretch of our group project, we started planning for the project report and how to best write it. Because it was 
            almost the end of the semester and we had other subjects’ tests coming up as well, we had to manage our time really well in order 
            to do this part effectively. But in the end, we finished the report in time to start working on the website.
        </p>
        <h4>
            <li>How the project can be improved in the future?</li> 
        </h4>
        <p>Currently, we have only scratched the surface of our group’s idea and haven’t carried out anything yet. However, with some research 
            into the technologies that are required for the learning management system, we can implement it and that would be the goal for our 
            foreseeable future as well. First, we can create a framework of the website using Python and SQL. And then using HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript, we can make the front-end of the web-application.
        </p>
        <p>Next up, since our Scope is quite big, we aim to find out which features are most important and refine them so that the web-application 
            can be even more user-friendly.  This also helps users not be overwhelmed when using the application and make the product more 
            appealing to users of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>Another important step to take in the future would be to test our product and have people test it. This will give us insight on how 
            effective the platform is and how it can be improved so that we can compete with the current learning management systems like Canvas 
            or Google Classroom. 
        </p>
        <p>And finally, since people’s learning information needs to be private and we respect that privacy a lot. What we can do is research 
            on cybersecurity and apply it to our project so that users can rely on the system keeping their information safe. 
        </p>
        <p>So, with effectiveness, user-friendliness, and information security as our top values for the product, we hope that in the future 
            we can make learning management easier for both students and teachers, which will improve the quality of education.

                            is no joke, it could result in many serious problems which could lead to money lost, fraud. That’s why cybersecurity plays an important 
                            role in almost everything online nowadays. The person working in the cybersecurity field means that they will mainly be responsible for

        <p>Ambitious as we were, constructing the real school management system was a challenging target. The project plan was proved to be much demanding in 
            both knowledge required and expected feature. Fundamentally, there were programming languages that were advanced compared to us freshmen, such as 
            JavaScript or SQL. Using these languages means that we must spend considerable amount of time researching and learning which was unattainable 
            considering the deadlines we got. Furthermore, the knowledge regarding those programming languages is never straightforward as there is a vast 
            quantity of functions within each section and sorting them out was challenging. Moreover, even if we were able to full grasp the techniques, 
            utilizing them requires experience and a deep understanding. Also, while applying and implementing the codes, there may arise issues that involve 
            the use of more sophisticated techniques such as APIs and cybersecurity. Additionally, the inexperience in building IT system will also hinder our 
            progress as we possess no prior knowledge regarding constructing and combining the system. Regarding the feature side, the complexity of some functions 
            turned out to be challenging. The searching and recommendation in Documentation tasked us with connecting the database of the courses to the internet 
            and sort out for relevant results. We were also hampered by the huge quantity of features that was impossible to achieve in due time.
        </p>
        <p>To address these issues, our group have agreed upon creating a figma of the product: Fig 2, Fig 3, and Fig 4 showing the Home page, Student Interface, 
            and Teacher Interface respectively. As for the countermeasure to immense number of features, we decided to limit the appearance of the functions on 
            the main page, restricted it so that only the most significant usages remained. For Students, that would be Courses, Timetable, Performance Tracking 
            and Document whereas Courses, Timetable, Marking and Document is the most significant to Teachers. In the process of constructing the Figma, we developed 
            a variety in theme between Teachers and Students. Every other function that is not listed in the main page can be viewed upon pressing the “…” button.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        
        <h4>
            <li>Programming language selection:</li>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The first milestone in building a school management system is choosing the appropriate programming language for the project. This product tasked us with 
            constructing a friendly user–interface and database used for storing data and documents from the clients. As first-year students in the field of 
            Information Technology, deciding on the right programming language without basic knowledge in web foundation is a huge challenge
        </p>
        <p>
            Our research in the front–end segments results in various options. There are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and even Bootstrap. Each of these languages 
            have their own superiority compared to the others which make the process of finalizing the decision even harder. In the end, our team decide to go with 
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the first two are the most feasible for beginners and JavaScript is excellent in handling web behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding the back–end, there are many choices that comes to our hand, namely NodeJS, PHP, Python, .NET, Ruby, and SQL. However, we all straightforwardly 
            unite under the idea of using Python and SQL as we believe that is the most suitable for building a database
        </p>
        <h5>HTML 5:</h5>
        <p>
            HTML 5 is one of the first programming languages that the students learn in their first year of university. Nevertheless, the programming language still 
            proved to be sufficient in building a suitable user–interface. The major objective of HTML is to provide blocks that make up the structure of the website. 
            That structure will then serve as the backbone for decoration and animation provided by CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h5>CSS 3:</h5>
        <p>
            Along with HTML, CSS is one of the friendliest programming languages for beginners while still being able to produce high quality interface. As the programming 
            language is also famous nowadays, it can be executed without the risk of mismatch in the technology. The main purpose of CSS is to enable the presentation of 
            layout, colors, and fonts.
        </p>
        <h5>JavaScript:</h5>
        <p>
            Although JavaScript is not initially accessible with our current knowledge, we believe it is worth the time to research and learn how to code in JavaScript. 
            The programming language itself is one of the most popular choices regarding the Front–end section with many distinct features. In this product, JavaScript 
            is responsible for the interactive features of web behavior.
        </p>
        <h5>SQL:</h5>
        <p>
            Just like JavaScript, SQL does not belong in our current knowledge asset but is tempting enough for us to strive for. It is said to possess the ability to 
            function at high speed, meaning an efficient and quick data flow for the user. Hence, we will use SQL to construct the back–end database for the management 
            system.
        </p>
        <h5>Python:</h5>
        <p>
            Being the first programming language and one of the most versatile one, Python is the first name came up to our mind when we were brainstorming our options. 
            Famous as it is, choosing Python also give us the chance to implement many open-source library that is both highly efficient and convenient for the developer. 
            The main logic of the product will be handled by Python.
        </p>
        <h5>GitHub:</h5>
        <p>
            Cooperation between freshmen in programming is challenging since everyone will have their own platform to work on and the result is conflicted when added together. 
            That is where GitHub truly shines. By using GitHub, the delegation between team members is more feasible as they can create a branch to focus on their own part. 
            Also, through pulling requests and committing to the main, our group can identify the conflict in our code and fix it without having to tamper the main branch.

        <h3>Communication:</h3>
        <li><strong>How we will communicate as a group</strong></li>
        <p>
            Clear communication between project participants is essential. This covers communications during class and when we cannot meet in person. First, we have a 
            message group on Facebook Messenger where we discuss fewer essential issues like verifying the time and location of meetings or notifying absences from 
            classes or seminars. Second, we have a Microsoft Teams group where we do our online discussions and go into greater detail about the project. Thirdly, 
            we will book our in-person meetings via the RMIT library website by checking which of the library's discussion rooms is open during the time we choose.
        </p>
        <li><strong>How frequently the meetings will be held</strong></li>
        <p>
            Our team usually meets three times a week, once in person and twice virtually. Every Wednesday at noon, an offline session will be held at the RMIT library, 
            and every Monday and Thursday at 7:30 PM, an online session will be held. While online meetings are used to plan and schedule what's best for the team and 
            the project, offline meetings give team members a chance to discuss any issues they are having with their work on the project.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Alternative communication channels</strong></li>
        <p>
            To upload and examine everyone's project-related work, we also set up a shared Google Drive. We fill out a paper for each online meeting that details the time 
            and date, the meeting's goals, and the topics we covered. For participants who could not attend the meeting to be still aware of what was discussed prior to 
            the next meeting, these papers are then uploaded to the shared drive in a folder called "Meeting minutes." We also utilize an excel spreadsheet to specify 
            project deadlines and the tasks that everyone must do before a particular date.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Approaches for helping members</strong></li>
        <p>
            Members will encounter issues in our group project that they need help resolving and the team's assistance. These issues could include undertaking topic-related 
            research or skipping a presentation or conference. Members with these issues can always email or ask questions via our Facebook Messenger group. The group will 
            do its utmost to respond to the members' inquiries and direct them to the project's ideal conclusion.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Risks:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Lack of programming experience</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Being RMIT University first-year students, most of our team has little to no programming experience, which could be a significant roadblock to developing our 
                    project. The coding and programming process is complex and challenging, much like the school system, which is complicated and diverse. The system's foundation 
                    is built on a combination of multiple programming languages, such as Swift, SQL, or JavaScript. This is a vast area of expertise and is exorbitantly tricky for 
                    beginners. Our team can only develop a workable design for creating the system's backbone with a firm grasp of these languages. Additionally, the project will be 
                    significantly hampered and slowed down if a system mistake happens or a required method is outside our knowledge. Our group has committed to learning the programming 
                    languages on our own to lessen the harm it does and has contacted counselors who can help us.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Insufficient performance monitoring</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The worst thing that could happen to any endeavor is for it to proceed more slowly than expected. It is always complex to monitor a project's completion because there 
                    are inevitably unforeseen problems. It can take longer to complete tasks because of bad experiences or poor time management, or the entire project might be placed on 
                    hold because of an unexpected error that surfaced during the trial session. Without a suitable answer, the team might have ended up meeting the deadline before 
                    completing their assignment. The additional time needed to address issues may also throw the preliminary plan off course, necessitating the members' creation of a new, 
                    time- and effort-consuming plan. To address this problem, our team created a detailed timetable with checkpoints for each stage of the project so that the participants 
                    could assess their performance considering those standards. The team will look for the issue and increase productivity to keep up with the progress if the findings are 
                    at odds with what was anticipated.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Miscommunication</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Every project's success depends on effective communication. A smooth exchange of information can get the process along much more quickly. However, it is not always simple 
                    to keep the interactions between the members consistent. Teammates' varied lifestyles and work styles are significant communication barriers. For the team to interact 
                    effectively, everyone must also agree on a set location for the conversation. Without these prerequisites, a task could go unfinished due to the improper use of communication 
                    platforms, or a response to a question could be delayed and impede the project's development. To address this issue, our group decided on a set online meeting starting at 
                    7:30 PM on Mondays and Thursdays and an offline meeting on Wednesdays. Without exception, every file and job delegation will be documented on our shared drive.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lack of dedication</p>
                <p>
                    Students have occasionally abandoned projects midway through, and every group has had to take precautions against this risk for a long time. The quality of the tasks assigned 
                    to a student will undoubtedly suffer if they decide not to commit to the project, or worse, they will not even turn in the work. When this happens, the project will be hindered, 
                    and numerous changes to the plan will need to be made. Either the team will need to persuade the student to complete their task, or they will need to deal with the fact that the 
                    member will disregard that task. Dealing with the lack of commitment will always take time and effort, regardless of the outcome. To address this issue, our group's initial 
                    meeting is devoted to learning about each other's course objectives and assigning tasks accordingly. Additionally, because everyone will have agreed on the issue, they will 
                    constantly be inspired to participate in the project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lack of engagement</p>
                <p>
                    A project can be completed only when the tasks are appropriately assigned to the various team members. Nevertheless, there are cases of group members choosing not to cooperate. 
                    It is either brought on by the oddness of new friends or resistance to social interaction. Whatever the motivation, refusing to cooperate is never beneficial. The tasks cannot 
                    be completed if teammates do not work together because disagreements may occur during data investigation, design mismatches during presentations, or disputes during the evaluation 
                    of proposals. In the worst circumstances, the issues might not be resolved because of each member's ego and resistance, leading to a proposal and presentation that lacks consistency 
                    and accuracy. In week three, we had a bonding activity where we played table tennis together to solve this problem. We have also chosen a group leader who will unite all the ideas 
                    into a cohesive concept.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lack of customers' attraction</p>
                <p>
                    The field of educational management applications is popular nowadays, and hence, our product has many competitors. These are big organizations with a history in the education segment, 
                    namely Canvas, Outlook, and VietSchool. To compete with those major organizations, having a refreshing user interface and optimized features is still insufficient. The project will not 
                    survive in the industry without occasional updates and significant benefits to attract consumers, as the competitors have already constructed a substantial customer royalty. To address 
                    this issue, in addition to the revolutionary changes in the current school management system, our application also needs to adapt to customers’ preferences and improve itself constantly.
