  <h1> Project Outcome </h1>
  <h3> 1. Figma</h3>


  <h3> 2.Functionalities. </h3>
  <h4> Similarities:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Courses: This section is where you can get information on courses that you are currently enrolled in or teaching.</li>
    <li> Timetable: This section acts as a calendar for the user to see upcoming events as well as your timetable/teaching schedule. It also alerts the user of potential conflicts with upcoming events.</li>
    <li> Document: The section is for the user to upload and store all their academic files such as e-books, notes, recordings, documents, teaching plans.</li>
    <li> Notifications: This function is to notify the user about upcoming events such as test dates, school events, homework deadlines. It also notifies the user about important tasks such as grading papers or preparing a lecture for students.</li>
    <li> To-do list: This section of the User Interface displays all mandatory tasks that the user needs to complete and can be modified by the user to include more tasks. The user can also tick off any tasks that they have done.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4> Differences:</h4>
  <ul>
    <p> Teachers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Marking: Teachers/Instructors can mark papers directly from this section and give feedback directly using this function. They can also highlight the parts where students did poorly and give advice for them to improve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Students: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Tracking: The students can keep track of how they did at school, see their score, and a chart that displays which areas they excel in and which areas they need to improve in. It also keeps track of grades and updates the students on the minimum grade for the next assignment/test for them to reach their goal.</li>
        <li> Group Finding: For subjects that require working in groups, students can use this function to find a suitable group based on their preferences. These preferences such as major, courses, course timetables can be set by the user and shown to everyone else.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>


  <h3> 3.How can it improve the present application?</h3>
  <p> Our product improves the current learning system by providing students and teachers a more intuitive educational experience while also focusing on the efficiency of the learning itself. Students also benefit from a more personalized learning experience based on their strengths and weaknesses. Teachers also have an easier time managing their students due to the nature of our system being online which can sort classes easily. It also enables easier communication between students and teachers as they can reach out to the teachers directly on the system.</p>


  <h3> 4.What is the stage the project currently at? What updates must be made for it to complete? What are the limitations?</h3>
  <p>Our project is currently in the design phase, and we haven’t moved on to developing or publishing it yet. We have a plan of what it can do as the Scope and the design for how the web-application will look when it is in operation. However, we have not started programming it yet due to our lacking skills and knowledge as freshmen in the IT field. Another limitation is time, as it is quite difficult for newcomers like us to be able to build an advanced system in less than a semester.</p>


  <h3>5. What do you plan to improve it? </h3>
  <p>Since we only have the design and the functionalities of the project planned out, some other aspects of a good product is still missing. For example, cybersecurity plays a crucial role in such a system due to the privacy of our user’s data being a top priority. Additionally, we plan to optimize the system so that it runs as smoothly as possible to provide users with the best experience while using our product. In the future, we can use our user’s feedback to come up with new functionalities that fit the user’s needs while integrating seamlessly into our system.</p>
